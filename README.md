## About the Project
This project aims to simplify the process of waste classification by utilizing machine learning algorithms. It can identify different categories of garbage such as recyclable, organic, and others, promoting better waste management practices.

### Features
- Easy integration with waste management systems.
- Supports multiple garbage categories.
- High accuracy classification model.


## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib


## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/HimanshuXDebug/Garbage-Classifier.git
   cd Garbage-Classifier
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the project: python app.py

3. Before excution of file download the file **https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CTvT_gnTvwlcKwJ8yz4jUOs0JYTKrplA?usp=drive_link** and set the path

OR

from Drive or you can Train your own model to train model you can run the program thru **Google Colab** or run the file which is avaiable on upper drive link 

You can download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
## Usage
Upload an image of garbage through the user interface or specify the path in the script.

The system will predict the garbage category.

View results and suggestions for disposal.
